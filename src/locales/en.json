  "project_sumup": "I completed this project called gnNews, which allows users to access news articles from different countries. While the project wasn't particularly difficult, it did require me to learn new technologies like Ant Design and Format.js, which I hadn't previously used. At first, I found the syntax of Ant Design to be challenging because I was more familiar with MUI, but after spending some time working with it, I was able to understand and use it effectively. Similarly, Format.js was new to me, but after some research and experimentation, I was able to implement localization successfully. Overall, working on gnNews was a valuable experience because it allowed me to expand my skillset and work with new technologies. While Ant Design and Format.js weren't required for the project, I decided to use them because they are the technologies used in GnStudio, and I wanted to gain experience working with them."
